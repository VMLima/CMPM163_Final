# Team Leviathan - Final Group Assignment

## Buzz Tilford
Buzz created the Sonar Ping effect. This also included a particle system, and treasure chest shader. She was also in charge of formatting the write up in the SIGGRAPH style and creating the video. 

## Gabriel McNeill
Gabriel created the Screen Wobble effect. 

## Victoria Lima
Victoria created the Light Ray effect. The effect was created using raymarching. It samples a Perlin Noise texture at every step to determine if there is light at that position. She also set up the GitHub repository.

## Instructions
Users can use the left mouse button to click on the terrain to generate the sonar effect. The closer the sonar effect is to a chest, the brighter red the chest will appear. The game camera moves and rotates on its own over time. The movement is used to show the light ray intensity change at different depths. Use alt-F4 to close the project.
